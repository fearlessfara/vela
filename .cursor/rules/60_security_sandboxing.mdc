# 60_Security_Sandboxing

MUST
- No access to Object.prototype chain; use `Object.create(null)` for maps.
- Freeze providers; no dynamic `this` capture.
- Disallow Function/eval/new Function anywhere.
- Validate JSONPath input to avoid prototype pollution.

SHOULD
- Limit recursion depth and template length to configurable caps.
