# 05_Style_Guardrails

TS RULES (MUST)
- "strict": true; noImplicitAny, noUncheckedIndexedAccess.
- No ambient `any`. Narrow with type guards.
- Pure functions where feasible; no global mutable state.

STRUCTURE (SHOULD)
- Small modules; one responsibility.
- No broad refactors across modules in a single PR.
- Use explicit return types on all exported symbols.

COMMENTS (MUST)
- Link to AWS-SPEC sections at function level.
- Keep Deviation Report current; list gaps + owner + ETA.
