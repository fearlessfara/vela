# Vela Rules — 00_Principles_No_Invention

MISSION
- Build a TS-only APIGW VTL engine (Chevrotain). Exact parity with AWS API Gateway mapping templates.
- Zero invention. No “smart” simplifications. No hidden refactors.

NON-NEGOTIABLES (MUST)
- Follow AWS behavior even when counterintuitive.
- Every change backed by AWS doc section OR captured golden test.
- Every new/changed file has:
  1) Header: `/** AWS-SPEC:<section> | OWNER:<name> | STATUS:<WIP|READY> */`
  2) Breadcrumbs: `// APIGW:<section>` around logic
  3) Footer: `/* Deviation Report: <bullets> */`
- Leave `TODO[APIGW:<section>]` for any ambiguity + add failing test.

PROHIBITIONS (MUST NOT)
- MUST NOT simplify grammar/semantics “for convenience”.
- MUST NOT reorder observable outputs, escape rules, or whitespace.
- MUST NOT introduce helpers not present in APIGW surface ($util/$input/$context).
- MUST NOT delete TODOs to pass CI.
