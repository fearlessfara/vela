# 40_Conformance_and_CI

GOLDENS (MUST)
- tests/conformance/<area>/<case>/{template.vtl,request.json,expected.apigw.txt,notes.md}

TOOLS (MUST)
- tools/run-apigw.ts — render
- tools/diff.ts — compare; fail fast on first diff

CI RULES (MUST)
- If any APIGW_* flag == ON → associated goldens MUST exist and pass.
- Missing headers/breadcrumbs/Deviation Report → CI fail.
- Deleting TODOs without closing tests → CI fail.
