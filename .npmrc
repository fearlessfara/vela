# Security Note:
# The remaining vulnerabilities are in bundled dependencies within the npm package
# used by @semantic-release/npm (a dev dependency). These cannot be fixed via overrides.
#
# - glob (GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2): CLI command injection - semantic-release uses programmatic API only
# - brace-expansion (GHSA-v6h2-p8h4-qcjw): ReDoS - not exploitable in semantic-release context
# - ip (GHSA-78xj-cgh5-2h22, GHSA-2p57-rm9w-gvfp): SSRF - not used by semantic-release
#
# These vulnerabilities do not affect the published package or its runtime security.
#
# Only fail CI on critical vulnerabilities
