# Photos Output Transformation Test

This test demonstrates integration response transformation based on AWS official documentation examples.

## Test Scenario
Transforms integration endpoint response data to match method response format.

## VTL Features Tested
- `$input.path('$')` - Accessing root JSON object
- `#set()` directive - Variable assignment
- `#foreach()` loop - Iterating over arrays
- `$foreach.hasNext` - Loop control variable
- `#if()` conditional - Conditional comma placement
- Property name mapping (public -> ispublic, friend -> isfriend, family -> isfamily)
- JSON object reconstruction
- Boolean value handling

## Input Data Structure
- Array of photos with different property names
- Additional description field that gets filtered out
- Boolean properties with different naming convention

## Expected Transformation
- Map property names to expected format
- Filter out unwanted properties (description)
- Maintain array structure
- Preserve all required fields
- Add conditional commas between array elements

## AWS Documentation Reference
This test is based on the AWS API Gateway documentation example for integration response transformation.
